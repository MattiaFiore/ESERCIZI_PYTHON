Kindness is a trick to turn you strange
'Til you're twisted and you're shining like a varicose vein
Anger makes you weak and turns you sick
And gets you in the six feet nice and quick
No fair
They can talk to me
I can live alone
I can live alone
Happy where I like to be
I can live alone, alone, alone, alone
I fought
For the right to be
I can live alone
I can live alone
The fairies get their fingers and they spin your wheel
And they make you look at sunshine that your skin will never feel
Baby, do you miss the days before
Hope knocked on your door?
But you went and fell in love
And into you love fell
And it made you feel unwell
Oh well
There's a thing about people that I suppose is alright
It's when they smile right at their pain through all the day and night
The fool dies at the altar in a smile
Says "I'm moving to America
You won't see me for a while"
If I get the ferry over, will the fairies follow me?
Will they throw me to the sea?
We'll see
No fair
They can follow me
I can live alone
I can live alone
Happy where I like to be
I can live alone, alone, alone, alone
I fought
For the right to be
I can live alone
I can live alone
When the devil takes your soul
He does not care
If you're shot down like a dog
Or expired on the stairs
The boat is drifting in, the weight is cast
How can life go so slowly
And death come so fast?
Across the River Styx I'll row along
But I've got one more song
More song
More song
More song
